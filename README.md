# PiSQUARE

## PiSquare, an RP2040 & ESP-12E based board, a smart way to use multiple Raspberry Pi HATs without stacking on Raspberry Pi. PiSquare uses Socket programming to communicate Multiple ("n" numbers of HATs) Raspberry Pi HATs wirelessly.

## There are several ways where you can find PiSquare very useful, as we were bound to use a single HAT on Raspberry Pi or max to max 3 Raspberry Pi HATs using PiStack, but you can't connect the same HATs twice on it (Like more than two UART or SPI based Raspberry Pi HAT at the same time) PiSquare let you connect as many HATs you want to without stacking it on Raspberry Pi whether it is SPI, I2C or SPI HATs and you can operate all Raspberry Pi HATs wirelessly. We used socket programming(TCP Protocol) 

## With PiSquare You can create the server from Raspberry Pi and run as many HATs as you like as a client to run multiple Raspberry Pi HATs, You can also make the PiSquare a client and run it as a master for all the other PiSquare as much as you want, Run any HAT on single PiSquare and control it via your phone, Make two Way communication between the client and server from PiSquare
